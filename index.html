            <p>Hi! My name is Charlotte Wong, and I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts
            University studying Electrical Engineering, with prospective minors 
            in Computer Science and/or Mathematics! Welcome to my (very much in 
            progress) portfolio/personal site. Here's a little about me: I grew 
            up in a small town in Massachusetts, around 30 minutes from Boston. 
            I've always been intrigued by the intersection between artistry and 
            technology. I grew up enjoying dance, music, mathematics, and visual
            arts. </p>
